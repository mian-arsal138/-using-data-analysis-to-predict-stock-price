**Introduction**

Welcome to Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning! My website, powered by linear regression and a Django App, provides real-time data of stock prices on the home page. To predict stock prices, simply navigate to the prediction page, enter a valid ticker value and the number of days you want to predict, and click the predict button. This page displays the predicted stock price along with the details of the searched ticker. We also generate a unique QR Code for easy access to the predicted results. On the prediction page, you'll find two graphs: the left graph shows the real-time stock price of the searched ticker for the past day, while the right graph displays the predicted stock price for the specified number of days. Additionally, our Ticker Info page provides comprehensive details about all the valid tickers accepted by the application.
